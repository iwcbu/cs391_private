# Assignment 2 for CS391X1, Summer I, 2025

## Total points: 100

## Description of the task

Please first study the code in the following directories:

- lectures/lecture-06-02: closure-base evaluation (ML-like)
- lectures/lecture-06-03: closure-base evaluation (Python 3)

Please implement a translation that compiles the extended
lambda-calculus back to Church's pure lambda-calculus. More
precisely, you need to "compile away" the following language
constructs in the extended lambda-calculus:

TMint, TMbtf, TMif0, TMopr, and TMfix.

This assignment aims at giving you a little "taste" for what
a compiler is like. It also tries to show how "impractical" it
can be to do arithmetic in the pure lambda-calculus!

You are expected to have all of your submitted code in one file of
the name `assign02.py`; this file should be stored in the directory
of the name `assigns/02/MySolution`. Please visit the following page
for information on creating a private repository of your own for this
class:
