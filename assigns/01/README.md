# Assignment 1 for CS391X1, Summer I, 2025

## Total points: 100

## Description of the task

Please first study the code in the following directories:

- lectures/lecture-05-21: substitution in ML-like syntax
- lectures/lecture-05-27: substitution implemented in Python 3
- lectures/lecture-05-28: substitution-based interpreter in ML-like syntax

Then translate the code in lambda1.dats (which can be found in
lectures/lecture-05-28) into Python3. You should follow the
translation of `term_subst` done in lecture-05-27.

You are expected to have all of your submitted code in one file of the
name `lambda1.py`; this file should be stored in the directory
`assigns/01/MySolution`. Please visit the following page for
information on creating a private repository of your own for this
class:
